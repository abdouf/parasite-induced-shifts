The files in this repository reproduce all the simulations and graphs in the paper, Fofana, A.M. and Hurford, A., 2022. Parasite‐induced shifts in host movement may explain the transient coexistence of high‐and low‐pathogenic disease strains. Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 35(8), pp.1072-1086.doi:10.1111/jeb.14053. 
S1 makes Pairwise Invasibility Plots, S2 runs the stochastic and spatially explicit evolution model (using the function StochasticLethargymodel), S3 generates the videos in the supp info of the paper.
